# UbuntuSetupScript
Using shadowsock &amp; proxychains4 to actually make it usable behind GFW

## Prepare
Edit "ssconfig.json". Or you can just use another way to surf the Internet scientifically, just remember to remove all the commands about shadowsocks and modify "proxychains.conf" by your own.

Replace the wallpaper as you like. The default picture names [**Where Tahrs Live**](http://www.vladstudio.com/zh/wallpaper/?where_tahrs_live) are made by [**Vlad Gerasimov**](http://www.vladstudio.com/). 

## Usage
Copy folder "scripts" to anywhere after you installed Ubuntu.

Open terminal and change directory to the folder "scripts". And type these commands.

    chmod +x ./setup.sh
    sudo ./setup.sh

Let's Roll!
